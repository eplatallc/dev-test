## Eudora Global Developer Test Codebase
Hello, and thank you for looking at the codebase for our developer test!
This is a bit of a preview of some of the problems you'd face working here.
It's also hopefully a chance to pitch ourselves to you, the developer considering us.

## About us:

  Our name is Eudora Global, and we're a cultivation capital.
  We are incubating several active companies in various industries, from professional gaming to international banking.
  Working with us in-house involves having a lot more fun than your typical dev 9 - 5, unless your job currently entails:

  * Going to professional Halo 5 tournaments
  * Staying in haunted mansions until midnight
  * Having Owner/CEO hosted made-up office sports tournaments for real prizes (racing backwards in rolling chairs?)
  * Pizza eating contests, and meeting senators, musicians, and athletes

  If the above doesn't explain enough about us, I'm not sure what else I got.

## Work Description:

  ### Expectations:

  * Troubleshoot bugs in Node, Cordova, and the browser. This may be platform specific or a core code issue.
  * Communicate over Git and do maybe one or two meetings a week. I do one.
  * Dive into other people's code. Make mistakes. Learn from them!

  ### Salary & Benefits:

  * $60K - $100K commensurate with experience, above industry average
  * Very Flexible Vacation, Holiday, PTO (the policy is literally take what you need, don't abuse it, communicate with others)
  * Optional Benefits (medical, dental, pre tax IRA)

## What we're looking for:

  ### Qualifications:

  * We're looking for developers with a few years experience in NodeJS, who are interested in long term employment.
  * Our current dream stack uses React, SQL, Cordova, Serverless, and GraphQL, so experience here is  considered a plus.

  ### Culture:

  * Work Life Balance: Enjoy your evening, enjoy your weekend. We try to avoid taking these up if at all possible.
  * Ready to Sprint: However, sometimes its all on the line and us devs have to lean in. Can we count on you in the clutch?
  * Tolerant: We have lots of different opinions on things, but we all agree that its okay to disagree.
  * Young and Old: We have some younger people here, and some older people here. Expect some Zeppelin.

## If interested in working with us:

  Send an email to jobs@eudoraglobal.com with your resume / portfolio, and we'll schedule an interview.
  To go straight to the front of the line, please demonstrate your skill by forking this repo and making a PR to make the game winnable or add a feature.
  If you feel your aptitude may be under-represented by your resume, then this is your chance to really showcase your knowledge!

## If you'd like help getting started:

  1. You'll need to fork and clone this repo.
  2. You'll need to install npm and nodejs on your machine.
  3. The dependencies must be installed with `npm install` from the cloned directory.
  4. You can start the server hot with `npm run dev`.
  Congratulations, the stack is running, the application can be visited at localhost:3000, and any changes you make will be hot reloaded, no server restart needed!
  From here on, the only remaining concern is solving the problem using your wit and creativity!

## About the stack:

  This code was originally forked off of:

  # ![unireact](http://martinbroder.com/unireact-logo.svg)
  
  For more info about this stack, check out the repo here: https://github.com/mrtnbroder/universal-react-webpack-boilerplate
  The reason this repo was chosen is that it's well maintained, open source, and has many architectural similarities to what we're using here at Eudora.
  We have made several different architectural decisions, but if you are apt around this style of codebase, you'll likely be comfortable around ours as well.
